2020 MIND news recomendation second place solution (I thought first place winners noahrs with high suspicion of using multiple accounts > 3, hope they can share all their solutions https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/250812591)  
I do not open source the code for the training loop using utils/melt gezi and husky so the code can not run, sorry(btw you can find some old code of melt from wenzheng/utils/melt).  
You can get most model part code from projects/ai/mind/src/model.py   
training use sh ./train/v17/body.sh  
tfrecord generated in projects/ai/mind/prepare    
Code can run on both tf 1.14+ and tf 2.1+
